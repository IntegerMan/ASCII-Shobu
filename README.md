# ASCII-Shobu
The modern classic board game Shobu, recreated as a console app.
IN PROGRESS!  NOT FUNCTIONAL AT THIS TIME!

 The goal of Shobu is to remove all of your opponents pieces on any ONE board.
 On your turn, you make first a "passive" move, then an "aggressive" move.  The main
 difference is that your passive move may not push any pieces, but the aggressive move may.
 To make your passive move, select one of your home boards.  That is, one of the 2 boards on
 your side of the screen.  Then, select one of your pieces, and choose where you would like
 to move it.  You may move it horizontally, vertically, or diagonally up to 2 squares away,
 but you may not push any pieces if it is your passive move.
 Then for your aggressive move, you must choose one of the two boards of a DIFFERENT color
 than the one you made your passive move on, but it does NOT have to be one of your home
 boards.  It DOES have to move the same distance and direction as your passive move did.
 This time, you may push one of your opponents pieces!  You may not push any of your
 pieces and you may not push 2 pieces with one move.  If you are able to push your opponent's
 piece off the board, it is removed from the game.  If you remove all of your opponent's
 pieces from one board, you win!
 
 Finally, it is possible to run out of legal moves.  If that happens, you lose.
 Enjoy!  And thanks for playing!
